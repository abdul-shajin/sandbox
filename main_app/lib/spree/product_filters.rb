      # Example: filtering by price
      #   The named scope just maps incoming labels onto their conditions, and builds the conjunction
      #   'price' is in the base scope's context (ie, "select foo from products where ...") so
      #     we can access the field right away
      #   The filter identifies which scope to use, then sets the conditions for each price range
      #
      # If user checks off three different price ranges then the argument passed to
      # below scope would be something like ["$10 - $15", "$15 - $18", "$18 - $20"]
      #search scope for time bound

      # Example: filtering by possible brands

      # First, we define the scope. Two interesting points here: (a) we run our conditions
      #   in the scope where the info for the 'brand' property has been loaded; and (b)
      #   because we may want to filter by other properties too, we give this part of the
      #   query a unique name (which must be used in the associated conditions too).
      #
      # Secondly, the filter. Instead of a static list of values, we pull out all existing
      #   brands from the db, and then build conditions which test for string equality on
      #   the (uniquely named) field "p_brand.value". There's also a test for brand info
      #   being blank: note that this relies on with_property doing a left outer join
      #   rather than an inner join.

      # Example: a parameterized filter
      #   The filter above may show brands which aren't applicable to the current taxon,
      #   so this one only shows the brands that are relevant to a particular taxon and
      #   its descendants.
      #
      #   We don't have to give a new scope since the conditions here are a subset of the
      #   more general filter, so decoding will still work - as long as the filters on a
      #   page all have unique names (ie, you can't use the two brand filters together
      #   if they use the same scope). To be safe, the code uses a copy of the scope.
      #
      #   HOWEVER: what happens if we want a more precise scope?  we can't pass
      #   parametrized scope names to Ransack, only atomic names, so couldn't ask
      #   for taxon T's customized filter to be used. BUT: we can arrange for the form
      #   to pass back a hash instead of an array, where the key acts as the (taxon)
      #   parameter and value is its label array, and then get a modified named scope
      #   to get its conditions from a particular filter.
      #
      #   The brand-finding code can be simplified if a few more named scopes were added to
      #   the product properties model.

      # to the argument type expected by the other scope.

      # scope that can be used directly (eg. testing only ever on a single property).
